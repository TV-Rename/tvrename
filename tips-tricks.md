# Tips, Tricks and Gotchas
## Tips from the Developers

* Most items can be double-clicked, to do the most "useful" thing for them.
* Folders, shows, and episodes can be right-clicked for appropriate actions.
* Column headers can be clicked to sort by that column.
* Folder lists support drag and drop of folders from Explorer, for quick and easy addition.
* You can remove items from the renaming and finding and organising lists by selecting them, and pressing "Delete" on your keyboard.
* If you double-click on a tab to select it, it will automatically do the "Find", "Check", or "Refresh" action for that tab.
* After making changes, you need to save before exiting (TV Rename will prompt you). If you screw something up, just exit without saving and your settings will be restored.
* TV Rename stores a lot of data in XML files. See [Technical Guide - Configuration Files](technical#configuration-files "Read the Technical Guide") for more information on what there is, and where it is.
* A number of TV Rename's functions can be accessed using the command line. You can find more details [here](cmd-line "Read about Command Line functionality").
* Whatever manipulation TV Rename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number. If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged, meaning that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules. At least, that's the theory. :)

## Other Tips
* Clicking a green cell in The Actors Grid will launch your browser targeting the actor whose column the green cell is in at the "Internet Move Database" [IMDb.com](http://www.imdb.com "Visit IMDb").
