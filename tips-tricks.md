# Tips 'n' Tricks (& FAQ's)
* Most items can be double-clicked, to do the most "useful" thing for them.
* Folders, shows, and episodes can be right-clicked for appropriate actions.
* Column headers can be clicked to sort by that column.
* Folder lists support drag and drop of folders from Explorer, for quick and easy addition.
* You can remove items from the renaming and finding and organising lists by selecting them, and pressing "Delete" on your keyboard.
* If you double-click on a tab to select it, it will automatically do the "Find", "Check", or "Refresh" action for that tab.
* After making changes, you need to save before exiting (TVRename will prompt you). If you screw something up, just exit without saving and your settings will be restored.
* TVRename stores a lot of data in XML files. See the files section for more information on what there is, and where it is.
* Whatever manipulation TVRename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number. If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged, meaning that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules. At least, that's the theory. :)
