#### About TV Rename

## Foreword ##
As ongoing work on the TV Rename guide continues Version 2.31 of the software has just been released.

The biggest changes implemented in this release are regarding entering show information, and using [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") as the reference data source rather than tv.com.

*Maintaining the documentation will always be ongoing, keeping the content accurate, up to date and relevant as TV Rename evolves can be tricky but any suggestions for improvements, or offers of help are more than welcome.*

## What TV Rename isn't
OK, before we get into all the really cool stuff TV Rename can do, let's get what it doesn't do out of the way...

**TV Rename does NOT download TV Shows** (But it can help you find TV Shows to download!)

## What TV Rename is
On the surface TV Rename will "fix" the names of downloaded TV Show files...

Say you've downloaded a few TV Show episodes, they will probably have names like: -

> ***Grey's.Anatomy.S03E04.blah.xvid.avi***

But you want them automatically renamed including the show and episode name and the season and episode number like: -

> ***Grey's Anatomy - S03E04 - What I Am.avi***

...then this is the tool for you!

## But wait... There's more!
**TV Rename can: -**
* Rename files, using data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit TheTVDB.com") and rules you can configure
* Monitor specified folders for TV Show files

> ***"Media Library"*** - *a folder (or folders) somewhere on your PC or NAS or whatever, with a bunch of TV Show files in it (them).*

**Once TV Rename knows about your Media Library it can: -**
* Copy (or move) files from monitored folders to your Media Library
* List any missing TV Show episodes/seasons in your Media Library
* Create web searches to help you find missing TV Show files
* Tell you how long you'll have to wait until the next episode of your current favourite TV Show airs

**To do all this clever stuff TV Rename makes extensive use of data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com"), without their database and API this tool would not exist! Please support them!**
