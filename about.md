Say you've downloaded a few TV episodes, and they have names like:

>  *Grey's.Anatomy.S03E04.blah.xvid.avi*

and you want them named more like:

> *Greys Anatomy - S03E04 - What I Am.avi*

..this this is the program for you!

**But wait.. Theres more!!!**

 * Rename files, using data from thetvdb.com
 * Check if you're missing episodes in your collection
 * Tell you how long until the next time a show airs
 * Monitor your library of folders for new shows and seasons
 * Monitor your download directories for new files
 * Copy files from where you download them to, to fill in gaps in your main collection
 * Un-name files, using names in a .torrent file
