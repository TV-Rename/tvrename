## What TVRename isn't...
OK, before we get into all the really cool stuff TVRename can do let's get what it doesn't do out of the way...

**TVRename does NOT download TV Shows** (But it can help you find TV Shows to download!)

## What TVRename is...
On the surface TVRename will "fix" the names of downloaded TV Show files: -

Say you've downloaded a few TV Show episodes, they will probably have names like: -

> ***Grey's.Anatomy.S03E04.blah.xvid.avi***

But you want them named with the show and episode name and the season and episode number like: -

> ***Greys Anatomy - S03E04 - What I Am.avi***

...then this is the tool for you!

## But wait.. Theres more!
**TVRename can: -**
* Rename files, using data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com") and rules you can configure
* Monitor your download directories for TV Show files
* Restore downloaded file names to those originally found in the .torrent files used to download them

> ***"Media Library"** - a directory (or directories) somewhere on your PC or NAS or whatever, with a bunch of TV Show files in it (them).*

**Once TVRename knows about your Media Library it can: -**
* Copy (or move) files from your download directories (and other locations) to your Media Library
* Check if you're missing TV Show episodes/seasons in your Media Library
* Quickly create web searches to help you find missing TV Show files
* Tell you how long you'll have to wait until the next episode of a TV Show airs


To do all this clever stuff TVRename makes extensive use of data from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com "Visit thetvdb.com"), without their database and API this tool would not exist!

 **PLEASE SUPPORT THEM IN ANY WAY YOU CAN!**
